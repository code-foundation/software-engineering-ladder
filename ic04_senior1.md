# SE Ladder 04: Senior Software engineer 1
(Individual contributor track)

## Comments
First level Senior Engineer's are not only aware of other work happening around them, but are starting to influence it. While not responsible for setting the overall strategic direction
of a project, they should be capable of filling in blanks when required.

At this point in their career, they should have at least one major area which they are they go-to expert in and can explain to other people. Examples of this might be; An AWS technology set, GraphQL, Testing, TDD, docker, microservices, ETL transformations. 

The move to this level is one of the biggest jumps in the ladder.

## Anti-patterns
Has pet projects with little or no business value. Communication is a common weak point for
first level senior engineers. As they are able to work for long periods of time with little supervision, they may forget to keep an eye on slack, email, and other communication channels. This
