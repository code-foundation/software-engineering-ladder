# SE Ladder 03: Mid-level Software engineer
(Individual contributor track)

## Comments
This is what most organisations would call a mid-level developer, or just developer / programmer.

At this point, a programmer should be comfortable with day to day development and not require constant checkins from seniors or management. Their focus should be on rounding out their experience and learning the areas outside of their core. As such, contributions to the wider discussion should be encouraged.

Promotions to this level should no longer need to be pulled on standards during peer review, and new hires at this level should move rapidly past peer reviews about standards and on to structural discussions within the first six to eight weeks.

## Level of autonomy
Multiple classes, changes to an existing class structure and how it effects the rest of the program.

## Skills Matrix
* Skills: SOLID, Composition over Inheritance, Unit tests, debugging.
* Toolchain: Suggests small standards improvements or changes to toolchain, can can solve simple problems with them without help (eg, dependancy issues, merge conflicts, etc).
* Communication: Communicates problems about their area they're working on if requirements are unclear or blocked. Can discuss what they're working on in broad strokes.
* Task management: Understand Agile, will self manage cards assigned to them, and own their cards through the peer review & merge process.
* Peer review: Should be taking part in peer review frequently, but is not required to sign off on large pieces of work.
* Architecture: Understands how their code fits into the existing architecture and implements existing patterns.
* Mentoring: Day to day, this is largely limited to explaining basic tool usage and their own work to other team members. However, engineers at this level should take the opportunity to share what they learn with the other members of their team, and help junior members with areas they are familiar with.

Tendency to yak shave. May not understand all the parts of their stack.
